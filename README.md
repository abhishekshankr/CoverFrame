<h1> Cover Frame Generator </h1>

Run and plugin and it will generate a cover frame for you. The safe area column can be toggled on and off using the layout grid option. 

The frame has a preset design for a cover template nested in an auto layout frame. You can delete this if you just want the safe zone columns and insert your own designs. 

<b>Note: The layout grid does not show up in exports.</b>
